<section id="cluster-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-1">Cluster 1</h2>
<p>En las tres olas el cluster se define de manera consistente por baja educación y retiro laboral: <em>Retired</em>, <em>No formal education</em>, <em>Primary education</em> y deciles bajos (1 y 3) aparecen siempre entre las categorías principales. El orden varía levemente (ej. en ola 04 <em>No formal education</em> sube posiciones), pero la composición del perfil se mantiene estable: es un grupo marcado por bajos ingresos y muy baja escolaridad.</p>
</section>
<section id="cluster-2" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-2">Cluster 2</h2>
<p>Se mantiene muy estable en torno a los trabajadores no calificados, baja escolaridad y deciles bajos. En todas las olas aparecen <em>Unskilled workers</em>, <em>Second decile</em>, <em>Primary/Secondary education</em> y deciles 3–4. El orden cambia entre olas (ej. en ola 04 y 06 sube la <em>Secondary education</em>), pero no cambia la naturaleza del cluster: sigue representando a los sectores trabajadores de base y bajos ingresos.</p>
</section>
<section id="cluster-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-3">Cluster 3</h2>
<p>Es el cluster más difuso: en la ola 01 se definía fuertemente por <em>Unemployed</em>, con baja presencia de ingresos bajos; en ola 04 la sobrerepresentración se da principalmente por “Unemployed” y en ola 06 el desempleo desaparece y es reemplazado por el primer decil y la educación primaria. Esto sugiere que el cluster 3 es algo más inestrable hacia la ola 06, aunque con sobrerepresentación de categorías probablemente relacionadas.</p>
</section>
<section id="cluster-4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-4">Cluster 4</h2>
<p>En las tres olas se define claramente por trabajadores calificados y educación secundaria/técnica. <em>Skilled workers</em> lidera en ola 01, luego se mantiene en ola 04 y en ola 06 aparece <em>Unemployed</em> junto con categorías de ingresos y educación media. Aunque hay ajustes en el orden, la coherencia es alta: es un cluster de sectores medios con credenciales técnicas y secundaria.</p>
</section>
<section id="cluster-5" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-5">Cluster 5</h2>
<p>En ola 01 se caracteriza por educación técnica/terciaria baja y deciles altos intermedios (7, 8, 9). En ola 04 gana peso la <em>Lower-grade service class</em> y deciles altos (8, 9), y en ola 06 se consolida con <em>Tertiary technical education</em> y <em>Skilled workers</em>. El orden cambia, pero la lógica es consistente: este cluster representa a clases medias-altas en ascenso, con educación técnica/universitaria y deciles medios/altos.</p>
</section>
<section id="cluster-6" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cluster-6">Cluster 6</h2>
<p>Es el más estable y con mayor coherencia sustantiva: siempre definido por la élite socioeconómica. En las tres olas aparecen <em>Higher-grade service class</em>, <em>Tertiary university education</em> y <em>Tenth decile</em> como principales categorías. El orden se mantiene relativamente constante y no entran categorías de bajos ingresos o baja educación. Es el cluster más estable y homogéneo a lo largo del tiempo.</p>
